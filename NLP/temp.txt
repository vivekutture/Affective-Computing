This got me even more confused because our front yard is closed off with a fence, how did she get in? Either way I took her inside and grandpa said he wouldn’t say anything to mom. I fed her and gave her water then she passed out in my bed. Soon after my mom came home and saw her, proceeding to tell the black dog to leave and find another home.
